First of all, thanks for your contribution!\
This project was done during the CentraleSupelec coding weeks.\
Thus, it aims to be an open source project and any help will be welcomed!

# What's the architecture of the project?
This project is a 3-part software:
- gui: This part deals with the GUI, displaying text to the user and gathering written code.
- ***_manager: This part controls the backend of the game.
- Core: This part creates connexion between backend and frontend. There, the user's code is tested, executed.


# How can I contribute?
- Fork this project
- Find an issue you can work on.
- Create your one branch
- When your part is done, create a pull request
- If everything's ok, we will merge your branch to the current project!


# Style Guideline
The project uses POO to make reusable, simple to read code.\
If you want to contribute, please, do not modify folder agencement (or a least, justify why) and keep going with POO style.\
Furthermore, we did our best to keep backend and frontend distincts. Try to keep the project clean ^^.

# Syntax
* __camelCase__ for package names
* __Pascalcase__ for class names
* __snake_case__ for function and variable names
